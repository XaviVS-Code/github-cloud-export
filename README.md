## ⚠️ OneDrive Status

> **Heads up:** OneDrive integration is temporarily disabled due to Microsoft sandbox access issues.  
> We're actively working to restore functionality once the Microsoft 365 E5 developer environment is provisioned.  
> Until then, Google Drive and Dropbox exports work flawlessly.
